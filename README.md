## Hey here's Alf S. 👋

**19-years-old student** who lives in Izmir, Turkey and (Ebreichsdorf) Vienna, Austria; studying for a bachelor's degree in CENG/IT, interested in Internet culture, games, technologies, music and I work voluntarily or paid as a Community Moderator, Project Moderator, Helper, Translator, Maintainer, Event Manager in many communities. I'm **still** working at [Discord Templates](https://discords.com/templates), [Discords.com](https://discords.com), [Saveron LLC](https://github.com/SaveronLLC) and BooHausmeister (private deutsch project). I translate some projects into Turkish, English and German on a voluntary and paid basis, some of which I serve as a Translator and Community Helper: [Discord Extreme List](https://discordextremelist.xyz), [Rust (Video Game)](https://rust.facepunch.com/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [GearBot](https://gearbot.rocks/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [AdBlock](https://getadblock.com/) and more. I also want to improve my German language level and speak this language comfortably through TELC, Goethe and other auxiliary resources.

As you can understand from the projects I have done 👨‍💻; I prefer to share my projects *open source* so anyone can search for bugs or add cool and improved code in my projects. The communities I have worked with are all* producing **open source** projects, and that's great! Also, if you want to contact me, *the fastest ways are* to reach me on Discord and Twitter: [@alfredsaveron](https://twitter.com/alfredsaveron) (Twitter)
