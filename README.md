### Hey, Alf here. 👋

I'm currently living in **Izmir, Turkey** and yes I'm Turkish Front-end and Game Developer, Community Moderator and Helper; and also here's • [My website](https://alfs.ga)! I'm still trying to learn Front-end. And yes; still trying to use the frameworks I've learned in my new projects, it's _really_ cool! 🚀

- I'm **currently** working at [Discord Templates](https://temp.gg), [Discord Extreme List](https://discordextremelist.xyz)! I recommend you to click on the links given to get information about these projects, I'm sure there will be a project / service that will interest you, so good luck.

- I'm **Turkish Translator • Community Helper** at [AdBlock](https://getadblock.com/) • [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) • [GearBot](https://gearbot.rocks) • [Discord Extreme List](https://discordextremelist.xyz) • [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) • [Rust Game](https://rust.facepunch.com/) and more. Also I'm trying to learn **German and French**. I hope very soon I can speak these languages fluently. ✨

- As you can understand from the projects I have done 👨‍💻; I prefer to share my projects **open source** so anyone can search for bugs or add cool and improved code in my projects. The communities I have worked with are all producing open source projects, and that's great! Also, To contact with me quickly: Twitter [@alfredsaveron](https://twitter.com/alfredsaveron)!
