### Hey it's me, Alf! üëã
Just random student living in Izmir, Turkey and learning some cool Front-end codes.

Currently living in Izmir, Turkey; I'm Turkish Front-end developer and I volunteer in many communities as a Community Moderator, Assistant, Helper and Translator. I'm **still** working at [Discord Extreme List](https://discordextremelist.xyz), [Discord Templates](https://temp.gg). I voluntarily translate some projects into Turkish *maybe French*, some projects where I'm Volunteer Translator and Community Helper: [Discord Extreme List](https://discordextremelist.xyz), [Rust (Video Game)](https://rust.facepunch.com/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [GearBot](https://gearbot.rocks/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [AdBlock](https://getadblock.com/) and more. Also I'm trying to learn *French*. I hope very soon I can speak these languages fluently. ‚ú®

As you can understand from the projects I have done üë®‚Äçüíª; I prefer to share my projects *open source* so anyone can search for bugs or add cool and improved code in my projects. The communities I have worked with are all producing open source projects, and that's great! Also, To contact with me quickly: [@alfredsaveron](https://twitter.com/alfredsaveron) (Twitter)
