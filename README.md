## Hey it's me, Alf! 👋
Just random student living in Izmir, Turkey / Ebreichsdorf, Österreich and learning some cool Front-end codes.

Currently living in Izmir, Turkey; I'm **Turkish** Front-end developer and I volunteer in many communities as a Community Moderator, Project Moderator, Helper and Translator. I'm **still** working at [Discord Templates](https://discordtemplates.com), [Discords.com](https://discords.com) and hype35 & vvg35 (currently private). I voluntarily translate some projects into Turkish, some projects where I'm Volunteer Translator and Community Helper: [Discord Extreme List](https://discordextremelist.xyz), [Rust (Video Game)](https://rust.facepunch.com/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [GearBot](https://gearbot.rocks/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [AdBlock](https://getadblock.com/) and more. Also I'm trying to learn *French* and *German*. I hope very soon I can speak these languages fluently.

As you can understand from the projects I have done 👨‍💻; I prefer to share my projects *open source* so anyone can search for bugs or add cool and improved code in my projects. The communities I have worked with are all producing open source projects, and that's great! Also, To contact with me quickly: [@alfredsaveron](https://twitter.com/alfredsaveron) (Twitter)
