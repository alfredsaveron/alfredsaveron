As you can understand from the projects I have done üë®‚Äçüíª; I prefer to share my projects *open source* so anyone can search for bugs or add cool and improved code in my projects. The communities I have worked with are all* producing **open source** projects, and that's great! Also, if you want to contact me, *the fastest ways are* to reach me on Discord and Twitter: [@alfredsaveron](https://twitter.com/alfredsaveron) (Twitter)
